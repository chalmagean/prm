# PRM

A simple Personal Relationships Manager for keeping in touch with friends and family.

## Description

The general idea is to have a tool that does one thing well and that is to _help you manage your personal relationships_ by reminding you to keep in touch. Most tools I've looked at either do too much or are too expensive for personal use so I've decided to build my own.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `prm` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:prm, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/prm](https://hexdocs.pm/prm).
