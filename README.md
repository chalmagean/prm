# PRM

A simple Personal Relationships Manager for keeping in touch with friends and family.

## Description

The general idea is to have a tool that does one thing well and that is to _help you manage your personal relationships_ by reminding you to keep in touch. Most tools I've looked at either do too much or are too expensive for personal use so I've decided to build my own.

## Inspiration

I really like the method Derek Sivers describes in his [Stay in touch with hundreds of people](https://sivers.org/hundreds) article about having four lists of people you want to keep in touch with.

- **A list:** Very important people. Contact every three weeks.
- **B list:** Important people. Contact every two months.
- **C list:** Most people. Contact every six months.
- **D list:** Demoted people. Contact once a year, to make sure you still have their correct info.

## Roadmap

Here's the next, big picture items:

- [ ] Contacts
- [ ] List management
- [ ] Reminders
- [ ] Web UI
- [ ] Get the first version out

You can see a detailed view of the roadmap in the [_Projects_](https://github.com/chalmagean/prm/projects/1) tab.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `prm` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:prm, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/prm](https://hexdocs.pm/prm).
